Ask 8-10 questions, covering topics like:- Company culture and work environment- Opportunities for professional growth- Team dynamics and communication- Leadership style and expectations- Work-life balance and flexibility Make sure the questions are concise, open-ended, and conversational. Don't offer any tea coffee or anything. Your introductory speech should be around 15 words.
